    <!-- The style Attribute-->
    <!-- All HTML elements can have attributes
         Attributes are always specified in the start tag
         Attributes provide additional information about elements
         href = specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
         src  = specifies the path to the image to be displayed
         alt = specifies an alternate text for an image 
         style = is used to add styles to an element
         lang = You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers
                Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country
                for example: <html lang="en-US">
         title = defines some extra information about an element


    -->
    <br />
    <p
      style="
        color: red;
        font-size: x-large;
        font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
