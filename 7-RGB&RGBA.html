    <h2 style="text-align: center">RGB Color Values</h2>
    <p>
      Each parameter (red , green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color
      with a value between 0 and 255.
      <br />
      This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!
      <br />
      For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its
      highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0.
      <br />
      Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is
      set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set
      to 0.
      <br />
      To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
      <br />
      To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255,
      255, 255).
    </p>
    <p>
      Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three
      parameters like : rgb(60, 60, 60), rgb(100, 100, 100), rgb(140, 140, 140)
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">RGBA Color Values</h2>
    <p style="background-color: rgba(57, 37, 233, 0.349)">
      RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha
      channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
      <br />
      An RGBA color value is specified with:
      <br />
      rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
      <br />
      The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0
      (not transparent at all):
      <br />
      Experiment by mixing the RGBA values below:
      <br />
      rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)

    <h2 style="text-align: center">HSL and HSLA Colors</h2>
    <h3>HSL Color Values</h3>
    <p style="border: 5px solid white">
      In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness
      (HSL) in the form:
      <br />
      hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
      <br />
      Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green,
      and 240 is blue.
      <br />
      Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is
      the full color.
      <br />
      Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.
      <br />
      Experiment by mixing the HSL values below:
      <br />
      hsl(0, 96%, 58%)
      <br />
      Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.
      <br />
      100% is pure color, no shades of gray
      <br />
      50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.
      <br />
      0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color.
      <br />
      Lightness
      <br />
      The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to
      give the color,
      <br />
      where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor
      light) 100% means
      <br />
      full lightness (white).
    </p>
    <h3>HSLA Color Values</h3>
    <p style="border: 5px solid white">
      HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an Alpha
      channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
      <br />
      An HSLA color value is specified with:
      <br />
      hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
      <br />
      The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0
      (not transparent at all):
      <br />
      Experiment by mixing the HSLA values below:
      <br />
      hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5)
